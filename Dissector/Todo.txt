Tasks:

--- Must Fix ---
Setup github repository
Package an installer
Get license sorted out
Make presentation videos about cool features

-- Try to get in --
Show changed render states between two calls
Mesh viewer for drawup calls
Better wireframe display for main window
Wireframe display for mesh window
Better alpha background for texture window
Spruce up shader compare results window
Pixel History for render targets
Pixel History for textures
Finding out if/why draw call doesn't rasterize (degenerate vertices, indices, etc)
Normalization for depth buffers
Shader debugger sometimes doesn't have last line debug info
Save everything (for later playback)

--- Some day ---
Show which texture are actually used by the pixel shader.
Pixel/Vertex shader 2.0 support. (2.0 shows steps but no values)
BUG: Sometimes values in for loops don't update every iteration. texColor.rgb in tilerenderer.fx
x64 support.
Handle lost devices and stuff( Just end the resim? )
Picking vertices from a mesh for debugging.
Changing render target for main display window
Make texture image window update when render call changes if appropriate
Set textureview title to render target/texture name or pointer
Depth for D16/D32 lockable types
Zoom/Pan main render window
Changing textures, render targets, vertex stream, index streams, vertex declarations, shaders.
Disable/Reorder/Create new draw calls
