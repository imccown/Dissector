Tasks:

--- Shortlist ---
Cube texture support
Choose which render target to view, and/or show all render targets
Add a find dialog (search for text in draw call descs or render states)
Finding out if/why draw call doesn't rasterize (degenerate vertices, indices, etc)

-- Try to get in --
Show changed render states between two calls
Mesh viewer for drawup calls
Better wireframe display for main window
Wireframe display for mesh window
Better alpha background for texture window
Spruce up shader compare results window
Pixel History for render targets
Pixel History for textures
Shader debugger sometimes doesn't have last line debug info
Save everything (for later playback)
Show texture formats and other useful information

--- Some day ---
Show which texture are actually used by the pixel shader.
BUG: Sometimes values in for loops don't update every iteration. texColor.rgb in tilerenderer.fx
Picking vertices from a mesh for debugging.
Changing render target for main display window
Set textureview title to render target/texture name or pointer
Zoom/Pan main render window
Changing textures, render targets, vertex stream, index streams, vertex declarations, shaders.
Disable/Reorder/Create new draw calls
